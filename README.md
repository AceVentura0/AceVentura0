### About me 🙌
I'm Tobias — a computer scientist by education, and an engineering leader by profession. I've spent most of my career in the automotive domain, leading international software teams across the full stack — from embedded to cloud to deep learning, most recently as R&D director at Bosch's automated driving division.

Currently I'm building my own venture focused on tech consultancy and agentic AI in the medical space.

I've loved coding since I was a kid (shoutout to MS BASIC! 🤟). Over the years, I’ve worked across domains — from desktop apps and scripting to web, IoT, cloud, and GenAI. Although time is limited these days, it's a top priority for me to stay up to date with latest tech.

### What I'm up to ☝️

🔭 I’m currently working on an LLM-based medical assistant, using Anthropic's beta API, with an eye towards an on-prem deployment down the line.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about LLM usage in a SaaS fashion and building WebApp frontends for my tools.
